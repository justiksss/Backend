Bridge specialists from construction firm Skanska loaded the 300-meter-long structure with trucks and then rocked it in a controlled manner to simulate its extreme load.</p><p>'"At last, we are entering the final stage with the construction of the Štvanická footbridge. If all load tests go well, the footbridge will open to the public in July,'" Prague Deputy Mayor Zdeněk Hřib, responsible for transportation, said in a press release.</p><p>'"The Štvanická footbridge is a truly unique structure, both in terms of construction and the materials used. Many things on the construction site are completely new even from the point of view of very experienced builders,'" Hřib added.</p><p>The new bridge has long been nicknamed HolKa – a portmanteau of Holešovice and Karlín, the two neighborhoods that it will connect. Holka is the Czech word for '"girl.'" Construction is complete, a railing with lighting has been installed, and work is being done on the connection to the surrounding roads and landscaping.</p><p>'"By putting the footbridge into operation, we will make the journey more pleasant and shorter for many Prague residents and visitors. So let''s keep our fingers crossed for the construction experts until the final finish,'" Hřib said.</p><p>Skanska project manager Michal Kunc said static tests used trucks with a total weight of over 70 tons, and dynamic tests used vibration exciter with a half-ton weight. '"We will use the data from both tests to precisely set the vibration dampers that will be built into the footbridge. Immediately after the tests, we will also start with the final treatment of the surfaces,'" Kunc said.</p><p>Petr Tej, one of the bridge’s architects. said the static and dynamic load tests are the last milestone before putting the footbridge into operation. '"From Prague''s point of view, this will create an essential link between Holešovice and Karlín,'" Tej said, adding that the project '"is mainly a continuation of the ongoing reconstruction of Bubenské nábřeží in Holešovice, the connection to the A2 cycle path in Karlín and the ongoing recultivation of part of Štvanice ostrov.'"</p><p>The new bridge will save people a significant amount of travel time.

7be818a7-3b97-4f5c-9a5e-7ce091e62753,"A slice of excitement: Domino''s opens first-ever Prague branchCurrently operating from Nusle, Prague 4, the famous US firm is planning to open a new store later this year.",2023-06-23 12:06:00,"<p>The world’s largest pizza chain by revenue, Domino’s, ceremonially opened its doors for the first time in Prague Thursday afternoon. The 63-year-old U.S. chain has high ambitions and plans to expand its network in the capital this year.</p><p>Based on a busy street in Nusle, the chain will prepare all of its pizzas and ingredients in-store using locally sourced products, ensuring that everything is as fresh as possible.</p><p>“We want to be the best in delivery…we have a 25-minute goal of completing orders, and the pizza should arrive with a heat of 70 degrees Celsius,” said Eugenio Becerro, the managing director of Daufood (linked with Domino''s) for Greece and Central Europe, at the opening. Quality, he says, is imperative.</p><p>Luis Garcia, the director of marketing for Domino’s Prague, told Expats.cz that the store will not use any food-delivery firms (such as Wolt, foodora, or Bolt Food) during the opening months.</p><p>“We want to ensure a strong relationship with our customers and community at the start, that’s why we want to take care of deliveries ourselves,” Garcia said. He pointed out that Domino’s is very much a neighborhood-centered branch. </p><p>Garcia also explained that, by using this method, fewer delays and hold-ups are expected. The focus, he explains, is to make a gradual entry into the Prague market – this will also help to avoid overburdening the staff that cook and prepare the pizza at the store.</p><p>The firm, however, does plan to cooperate with food-delivery companies later on. For now, orders can be placed via the app, online, or by simply calling. You must live within a specific delivery area in order to get your food, otherwise, you’ll need to collect it at the Nusle store.</p><p>At present, delivery costs CZK 39, and Domino''s interestingly charges a so-called box fee. You''ll pay CZK 15 for a large-pizza box, and CZK 10 for a medium one. A starter or side also comes with a CZK 10 box fee. A medium (29 centimeters) Margherita pizza costs CZK 199, and a large (36 cm) is CZK 259. Stuffed (cheesy) crust costs an extra CZK 49.</p><p>A serving of potato wedges is charged at CZK 59 and a small brownie for dessert is CZK 49. For liquid refreshments, a 0.33-liter can of Coca-Cola costs CZK 35, and Domino''s even sells beer (0.5 liters of Gambrinus), which costs CZK 45. A full list of pizza and other food prices can be found on the <a data-cu='"https://www.dominospizza.cz/menu/nuselska#pizzas'" data-cwid='"1906094'" href='"https://www.dominospizza.cz/menu/nuselska#pizzas'" target='"_blank'">website</a>.</p><p>This is a first for Prague, but not for Czechia. </p><p>In 2019, Domino’s opened its maiden Czech branches in Brno. Since then, one has closed, but the other is performing well – strongly enough to prompt an expansion to the capital.</p><p>The Brno branches, which were pilots, opened in Czechia’s second-largest city not only to gauge demand but also because of its proximity to Austria. “We opened in Brno because it strategically made a lot of sense. We were able to source many ingredients and items from Austria, which is nearby and has a strong Domino’s presence,” Garcia explains.</p><p>Garcia interestingly also explained that, despite its fame, Domino''s is not known by many Czechs. He wants to change that via online and in-person marketing.</p><p>What about the future? If all goes well, Nusle will be one of several Domino’s branches in Prague. And the company has big aspirations: it plans to open a branch near the capital’s very busy I.P. Pavlova area later this year and has eyes on other (undisclosed – sorry!) locations in the near future.</p><p>“We plan to connect all of Prague’s Domino’s chains together so that they cooperate with one another,” Garcia says, which will broaden the company’s delivery areas and should ultimately make deliveries speedier. </p><p><a data-cu='"https://www.dominospizza.cz/'" data-cwid='"1906077'" href='"https://www.dominospizza.cz/'" target='"_blank'">The website</a> is readily available in English and also includes the current average delivery time and a real-time tracker of when your pizza will arrive. </p><p>To mark its opening, the firm is offering several deals such as buying two pizzas and getting one free. Various types of pizza are on offer, including: kebab pizza; chicken burger pizza; BBQ bacon; cheeseburger pizza; and diavola. You can also “build your own pizza” or try the “half-half” option, which allows you to try two types in one.</p><p>The pizza is of a typical U.S. style with thicker crusts – you can also choose to stuff your crusts. Alternatively, Domino''s also offers an '"Italian style'" pizza, for those who prefer thinner crusts. Sides include stuffed cheesy bread, potato wedges, breadsticks, chicken wings, and more.</p><p>The opening of the Domino’s branch will not only please fans of traditional U.S. pizza, but may also significantly disrupt the pizzeria industry in Prague – Pizza Hut, which has three chains in Prague, may be looking over its shoulder.</p><p>Bustling with people following its launch, the renowned firm will hope that the Nusle branch is one slice of many, future successes – something Domino’s is evidently hungry for.</p>",the-opening-of-the-nusle-store-on-june-23-2023-photo-twitterusembassypragu-gkauu

Minister of Defense Jana Černochová promised earlier this year that the agreement would not permit the establishment of a U.S. military base on Czech soil.</p><p>The government has today agreed to increase the parental allowance by CZK 50,000, to a total of CZK 350,000. However, the allowance must now be utilized within three years (rather than the current four). </p><p>If passed, the law amendment will come into force at the beginning of 2024. The coalition is currently deciding if the law will only apply to children born after Jan. 1, 2024, or whether it will be retroactive. Last year, parental allowance cost the state CZK 33 billion.</p><p>President Petr Pavel today nominated deputy president of the Municipal Court in Prague Veronika Křesťanová to become a new Constitutional Court judge. </p><p>Křesťanová expressed her gratitude for the nomination, considering it a significant recognition of her previous work, particularly in the fields of personality protection, copyright, and media law – subjects she specializes in. Her notable cases include examining the authorship of former President Václav Klaus'' amnesty text and – recently – ruling on a nurse''s claims against a media publisher for disregarding the presumption of innocence.</p><p>The websites of Czech Radio – Rozhlas.cz and iRozhlas.cz – have been operating in a limited mode since a hacker attack on Thursday evening, according to the company. While textual content remains intact, only a portion of the audio and images that had been stored on the compromised disk arrays in the data center are accessible. </p><p>Czech Radio spokesperson Jiří Hošna stated that they are actively working to restore functionality by migrating images from their platform and seeking data from external sources. It is uncertain how long this will take. Technical details and the identity of the attacker remain undisclosed pending investigation. The attack was believed to be linked to a media and Ukraine conference, with the intention of disabling public media web services.</p><p>The PPF Group, a Czech-founded global investment firm, announced today that it is considering the acquisition of Packeta, including its subsidiary Zásilkovna, a logistics company in the Czechia. PPF CEO Jiří Šmejc stated that he would only be interested in acquiring the entire company. Packeta saw a 23-percent increase in turnover to CZK 6.1 billion in 2022. </p><p>Shipments rose by 25 percent to nearly 90 million, and the company operated over 15,000 delivery points across four countries.

State enterprise LOM Praha, which will service the choppers, confirmed the news today.</p><p>The Defense Ministry will allocate approximately CZK 1.3 billion for servicing until 2030. Czechia is purchasing an additional eight Venom helicopters and four Viper fighters, while also receiving six used Vipers and two Venoms as a gift from the U.S. for aiding Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.</p><p>At an EU foreign ministers’ meeting in Austria today, the foreign affairs ministers of Czechia, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, and Italy called for a faster EU enlargement process for the Western Balkans. They emphasized the need for accelerated integration with concrete steps to be taken from 2024 onwards.</p><p>The ministers expressed concerns about the slow and bureaucratic nature of the enlargement process, which has resulted in disillusionment and alienation among the people of these countries – particularly the youth. They also highlighted the threat posed by Russia''s aggression against Ukraine to both the EU and the Western Balkan countries. Candidates for EU membership in the Western Balkans are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania.</p><p>According to a recent <a data-cu='"https://www.median.eu/cs/?p=3130'" data-cwid='"1906029'" href='"https://www.median.eu/cs/?p=3130'" target='"_blank'">survey by the Median agency</a>, the current government coalition parties would not secure a majority in the Chamber of Deputies elections. ANO movement leads with 34.5 percent voter preferences, followed by ODS (15 percent), Pirates (10.5 percent), and SPD (8.5 percent).</p><p>The coalition parties have a combined support of 41 percent and would win 92 parliamentary seats, falling short of a narrow majority by nine votes. The survey was conducted online and through household visits from May 1 to June 2, 2023, with 1,012 respondents. Dissatisfaction with democracy functioning was also highlighted in an Ipsos survey.</p><p>Heavy thunderstorms in the Czech Republic brought relief from the recent hot weather. Despite initial concerns, the storms turned out to be milder than expected. Precipitation totals were high in some areas, causing fallen trees and localized damage. However, the storms primarily affected Germany and reached the Czech Republic later at night. </p><p>Train services faced interruptions due to damaged traction lines and security equipment. The storms gradually subsided, and cooler temperatures were forecasted for the weekend. Wednesday''s storms had already caused disruptions, with wind gusts and lightning strikes leading to damage and power outages in some areas.</p><p>Prague Zoo celebrated the birth of bush dog puppies after a five-year hiatus. The pair of cubs, born on April 8, are the first offspring of a newly introduced breeding pair of these challenging-to-breed wild dogs. Visitors have not yet been able to see the puppies as bush dogs are sensitive while raising their young.</p><p>The zoo confirmed that people can now observe the puppies in the outdoor enclosure of the small American carnivores area. Bush dogs, native to Central and South America, are threatened by habitat loss, declining prey, and disease transmission. The species is categorized as near threatened on the IUCN Red List.</p><p>Prague criminal investigators have released footage of the suspects, a group of five men, who assaulted a foreigner in Prague on December 28 in Prague''s Old Town. The attack left the victim permanently injured and blinded in one eye. Authorities have released CCTV footage of the suspects, urging the public to come forward with any information. </p><p>The police spokesperson emphasized that the consequences of the attack were severe, and the victim''s vision loss was irreversible. The investigation is focused on charges of disorderly conduct and bodily harm, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to eight years.</p><p>PPF Group incurred significant costs in leaving Russia after the Ukraine invasion, amounting to hundreds of millions of euros. Despite this, the group would have had higher profits last year than pre-pandemic levels if not for the Russia-related expenses, according to PPF Director Jiří Šmejc. PPF reported a net profit of €140 million in 2022, a 49% decrease from the previous year, while assets declined by 5.5% to €39.9 billion. </p><p>Šmejc emphasized the importance of leaving Russia quickly, stating that principles outweighed financial gains. PPF''s investment strategy will continue to focus on telecommunications, media, financial services, and e-commerce, with an emphasis on influencing long-term company outcomes.</p>",illustrative-image-istock-sinonimas-xmkqi

A new exhibition at the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art called Infamous Beauty presents 120 large-format photographs showing a cross-section of his career. </p><p>For four decades, Serrano has dealt with social issues, sexuality and fetishes, racial intolerance, and the darker aspects of the human condition. He has photographed Ku Klux Klan members, the dead in a morgue, close-ups of firearms, and the homeless in New York’s subway system.</p><p>The exhibition has several complementary parts. In the main hall, under the title Beauty, over 60 works show highlights of the artist’s long artistic career. DOX also shows the complete Infamous series from 2019. A third space is dedicated to Serrano’s latest series, Confessions, oil pastel drawings by Serrano over black and white photographs of sculptures by Michelangelo.</p><p>Exhibition curator Otto M. Urban said Serrano’s unconventional works are filled with artistic nods to the old masters: '"As an art historian, I like it when you can find a reference to art history in the works, which Serrano makes,'" Urban said. He added that people can find a painterly perception as well as artistic geometry in the photographs.</p><p>'"In some of his portraits, one can see the famous 19th-century American photographer Edward S. Curtis, and he also mentions Caravaggio and Baroque paintings. That is why I was immediately attracted by how he works with references and how he transforms the works of older artists,'" Urban said.</p><p>Serrano, who came to the opening earlier this month, said he was pleased with the Prague exhibit. '"My work is fluid and transitional, that is to say, it’s an organic process. One picture leads to another, one idea, one series transitions into the next one. It’s a thread that links everything I do from one day to the next, one month, one year, one decade to the other,'" Serrano said.</p><p>“Otto Urban, who curated this exhibition, understood that for my first ever exhibition in Prague, the exhibition had to be a bang-up show with no holds barred.

The talks are intended to encourage participants to rethink their own ideas and discover new points of view.</p><p>The theme of this year''s event, “Nonsense,” promises to reveal new takes on sense and nonsense in education; bring interesting perspectives that can open up creative space; contribute to further development in areas such as the future with regard to artificial intelligence and relationships between children and teachers; and touch on controversial topics in the education system.</p><p>Individual talks will be in either English or Czech, with simultaneous translations available to make them accessible. The conference is open to the public and tickets can be purchased through the GoOut platform. It is held under the auspices of the City of Prague and the Prague 7 Municipal District.</p><p>“This year''s theme of nonsense is playful and will encourage us to ask questions such as: does it make sense to us? Isn''t it nonsense? Can nonsense make sense? And that''s what I enjoy,” TEDxPragueED ambassador Markéta Jedličková said.</p><p>Attendees can expect provocative and inspiring ideas from well-known and lesser-known speakers. They will discuss how seemingly irrational ideas and concepts can lead to discovery, educational progress, and societal transformation.</p><p>Speakers will cover topics ranging from artificial intelligence, which is becoming increasingly pervasive, to transgender issues in education. A standout guest this time is Christopher Rosewarne, a film concept designer who has worked on the look of several high-profile projects including the current versions of Dune.</p><p>The supporting program will feature an unusual performance by singer Marley Wildthing. Participants will be able to see the paintings of street artist Julius Reichl, who received a suspended sentence at one time for his graffiti activities. </p><p>The lettering style from one of his paintings was used to create the event''s main graphic and appears on all promotional and graphic artwork. “I don''t think of myself as a painter. I try to work as a typographer with the layout of the surface, with the image almost like a poster,” Reichl said.</p><p>Another side activity is a financial game taking people through their entire financial life from adulthood to retirement. It is in partnership with People in Need, an NGO that has a large variety of educational programs.</p>",this-edition-of-tedx-prague-will-be-held-at-dox-photo-dox-ppxkc

The decision marks a significant development in the ongoing battle for taxi services at the airport.</p><p>The decision is not yet final, however, as competitor Tick Tack, which had originally filed a motion for review, now has the opportunity to file an appeal within 15 days. Tick Tack, a subsidiary of Taxi Praha, has been providing taxi services at Prague Airport in collaboration with the company Fix since 2016.</p><p>Late last year, Uber <a data-cu='"https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/uber-to-become-official-taxi-service-for-prague-airport'" data-cwid='"1904587'" href='"https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/uber-to-become-official-taxi-service-for-prague-airport'" target='"_blank'">emerged as the winner of the tender to operate the official taxi service at Prague Airport</a>. Initially, Uber was scheduled to commence operations at the airport in February, but due to objections raised by competitors, the start date was postponed. Subsequently, the Czech Office for the Protection of Competition initiated an investigation into the tender process.</p><p>Martin Švanda, a spokesperson for the Office for the Protection of Competition, confirmed that the authority rejected Tick Tack''s proposal for review, stating that no grounds for corrective measures were found in the contracting authority''s procedure. </p><p>Švanda added that certain parts of the proceedings were halted due to inadequately filed objections. The finality of the decision is crucial because Prague Airport cannot enter into a contract with Uber until the process is concluded.</p><p>If Tick Tack chooses not to file an appeal within the allotted 15-day period, the decision by the Office for the Protection of Competition will become final. In that case, Uber will be able to officially sign a contract with Prague Airport. </p><p>However, if Tick Tack decides to file an appeal, a second-level proceeding will be initiated, which is expected to last at least two months. During this time, further examination and evaluation of the tender will take place.</p><p>Uber''s successful bid for the tender at Prague Airport came with certain conditions. One of the fundamental requirements is that the operator must set the final price before each trip, utilizing their software to calculate the fare. This stipulation ensures transparency and prevents any fare manipulation.</p><p>Additionally, the operator must guarantee a high standard of service quality and safety, maintain a fleet of vehicles no older than three years, and ensure that drivers exhibit professional behavior. Proficiency in English and Czech is also expected from the drivers to facilitate communication with passengers. </p><p>Furthermore, the operator must offer cashless payment options to provide convenience for passengers. Accessibility is another key aspect, with the requirement to accommodate disabled passengers and families with children. The operator is also responsible for ensuring an adequate number of available vehicles at the airport to meet the current demand.</p><p>Klára Divíšková, a spokesperson for Prague Airport, expressed satisfaction with the decision of the Office for the Protection of Competition. Divíšková also mentioned that once the decision becomes final, preparations for the commencement of operations by the new taxi service provider can begin in earnest.</p><p>The outcome of this tender will have a significant impact on taxi services at Prague Airport. Uber is poised to become the official provider, introducing its innovative approach and technology to streamline and enhance the passenger experience.</p>",taxi-stand-at-prague-airport-photo-istock-chris-cook-wfvhn

At present, it provides inpatient care and plans to open an acute, emergency service in 2023 according to its <a data-cu='"https://www.cdr-akeso.cz/nase-vize-pece/nejcastejsi-dotazy'" data-cwid='"1905332'" href='"https://www.cdr-akeso.cz/nase-vize-pece/nejcastejsi-dotazy'" target='"_blank'">website</a>. The facility says that it has a contractual relationship with all health insurance companies.</p><p>'"We are bringing several fundamental care innovations. We concentrate good practices from many other facilities in one place. New technologies will also be an advantage. For example, we are proud of [our use of] circadian biodynamic lighting,” said a psychiatrist who will work at the center, Martin Hollý.</p><p>Válek said that the new unity is funded via private sources – this is a rarity, he says, because “psychiatry is not seen as a field that is economically profitable for a private entrepreneur.” He also explained that many hospitals technically lose money on psychiatric wards.</p><p>AKESO Holding, which belongs to Greek businessman Sotirios Zavalianis, is the owner of the hospital. AKESO also runs the Hořovice hospital, the Multiscan Pardubice radiology and oncology center, and a diagnostic center in Prague''s Nové Butovice area.</p><p>According to statistics, one in five Czechs suffer from some form of mental illness during their lifetimes, but not even half of those who are unwell receive professional care. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also mentioned that mental health care has long been one of the weakest areas of the Czech healthcare system. </p><p>In 2021, <a data-cu='"https://www.mzcr.cz/nova-epidemie-adolescenti-se-poskozuji/'" data-cwid='"1905341'" href='"https://www.mzcr.cz/nova-epidemie-adolescenti-se-poskozuji/'" target='"_blank'">research</a> showed that about 700,000 people in Czechia were diagnosed with a psychiatric issue. <a data-cu='"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/ekonomika-b2b-i-akutni-pripady-cekaji-na-pomoc-mesice-system-psychiatricke-pece-kolabuje-232329'" data-cwid='"1905341'" href='"https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/ekonomika-b2b-i-akutni-pripady-cekaji-na-pomoc-mesice-system-psychiatricke-pece-kolabuje-232329'" target='"_blank'">According </a>to Peter Winkler, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, mental illness today accounts for roughly 15 percent of all domestic illnesses.

However, he highlighted concerns over the potential fatigue of Western countries in response to a potentially prolonged conflict.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin strategically relies on Western fatigue and disunity to further his military aggression in Ukraine, Pavel opined. Putin calculates that as conflicts lose urgency over time, Western leaders and citizens will become preoccupied with their everyday concerns, thus losing their resolve. </p><p>Despite the challenges that Czech citizens face, such as economic issues at home, Pavel commended their unwavering support for Ukraine. He also praised the Czech government''s continuous provision of military and humanitarian aid. According to the Czech president, abandoning Ukraine would be tantamount to democratic countries abandoning themselves.</p><p>Turning his attention to China, Pavel underscored the significance of taking its power ambitions seriously. He said that while an armed conflict between the West and China may not be imminent, it would be unwise to repeat the mistakes of inaction. He emphasized the existential importance of strengthening relations with all democratic countries worldwide within this context.</p><p>Prime Minister Petr Fiala, who also spoke at the conference, said that Russia has shown its willingness '"to cross all limits” in the future in order to succeed in the war. “We are facing a scenario of a frozen conflict, which would mean the creation of a center of permanent security instability in Eastern Europe,'" he added.</p><p>According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Lipavský, the West is standing on the threshold of a global conflict.

The Lobeč Steam-Powered Brewery was one of eight places across Europe to win in that category. The awards are given out by the European Commission and Europa Nostra, a federation that supports cultural heritage.</p><p>The brewery in Lobeč, in the Kokořín protected landscape, has a <a data-cu='"https://lobec.cz/o-nas'" data-cwid='"1905105'" href='"https://lobec.cz/o-nas'" target='"_blank'">history dating back to 1586</a>. It fell into disrepair in the latter half of the 20th century.</p><p>The long-term project to restore the brewery – also called Parostrojní pivovar v Lobči – has enlivened the small village of 140 inhabitants and has ensured that the brewery''s beer can be enjoyed for generations to come.</p><p>The awards jury said the restoration is a good example of a sensitive rehabilitation of industrial heritage that has preserved the original character and the original use of the structure.</p><p>“This is a great achievement for individuals who invested a lot of time and personal resources to achieve their ambitions. It is a courageous project which sends a strong message about the importance of strong community engagement and collaboration between many different stakeholders,” the jury stated.</p><p>The present-day brewery and malt house date to the first half of the 17th century. In the 1890s, it transformed into an industrial brewery with a steam engine. Production stopped in 1943; the site had been abandoned since the 1980s.</p><p>The project was mostly funded by the owners’ own financial resources with some support from the Czech Culture Ministry and Environment Ministry. The European Union’s Rural Development Program also helped finance the restoration.</p><p>“The Steam Brewery in Lobeč is a perfect example of the connection of the historic and the new, the continuation of the life of a historic building in modern times'" and of the effect of '"a careful restoration of a monument with a plan for its further use'" on '"the life of the entire community or village,” <a data-cu='"https://lobec.cz/obnova-parostrojniho-pivovaru-v-lobci-ziskava-cenu-za-nejlepsi-evropske-dedictvi-2023'" data-cwid='"1905111'" href='"https://lobec.cz/obnova-parostrojniho-pivovaru-v-lobci-ziskava-cenu-za-nejlepsi-evropske-dedictvi-2023'" target='"_blank'">Culture Minister Martin Baxa said</a>.

The duo had a dream of living in a monument and developing cultural activities in the countryside.</p><p>The initial phase of the restoration focused on preserving the site, followed by a careful structural restoration. From 2014 onward, the site was opened to the public with a mix of cultural and business activities to ensure its future sustainability. The site uses a system of part heat pumps and part geothermal energy for heating.</p><p>After the restoration, the original function of beer production was re-established. The craft brewery makes lagers, ales, a stout, a Belgian-style white beer, and a special herb beer that is not flavored with hops.</p><p>The brewery’s revival has brought life back to the village, with new families arriving. “The brewery, the local chateau, and the community activities make the small village a unique place to visit.

The sixth edition of the festival will bring international music stars, a podcast festival, a program for the whole family, enhanced public transportation, and a new comfort zone.</p><p>The first day will be a bit of a preview event, with just two bands – the Queens Orchestra from Ukraine and Czech music star David Koller. Queens Orchestra, composed of 17 women, will be in Prague for the first time. They play jazz, rock, and modern interpretations of classical music. They hope to use culture to remind people that the conflict in Ukraine is still going on. </p><p>David Koller has also been active in supporting Ukraine and has personally participated in humanitarian work.

Over 25,000 people are expected to attend.</p><p>“This year''s edition is the most prepared we''ve ever been, and it will run exactly as we originally envisioned,” festival co-organizer David Gaydečka, said, adding that there will be some surprises as well.</p><p>Organizers have continued to fine-tune the gastronomy, services, facilities, and accompanying activities.

Next to that area, a new comfort zone was created in partnership with mobile operator T-Mobile. The comfort tickets allow for faster entry to the festival through additional entry points and let people use a partly covered comfort zone that offers 20 percent off on beverages. T-Mobile customers can get comfort zone tickets at a discount.</p><p>Metronome Prague will not only be about music. The accompanying program includes outdoor art installations, exhibitions, an adventure escape game, workshops, film and theater productions, a sports zone, a cache hunt, and a hip-hop dance school.

The “Prague solstice mystery” occurs every year on the first day of astronomical summer, which this year is June 21. If you stand at the Old Town Tower of Charles Bridge and look toward Prague Castle, the sun sets over the roof of St. Vitus’ Cathedral, right over the main altar.</p><p>Emperor Charles IV was a big believer in astrology and superstition. When he planned <a data-cu='"https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/emperor-charles-iv-planned-new-town-to-be-heaven-on-earth'" data-cwid='"1904785'" href='"https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/emperor-charles-iv-planned-new-town-to-be-heaven-on-earth'" target='"_blank'">his building projects</a>, he often infused them with a mystical element. The location of Charles Bridge was shifted slightly from <a data-cu='"https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/on-this-day-the-medieval-judith-bridge-collapsed-in-1342'" data-cwid='"1904785'" href='"https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/on-this-day-the-medieval-judith-bridge-collapsed-in-1342'" target='"_blank'">the previous Judith Bridge</a>, in part to facilitate the alignment.</p><p>The solstice is the longest day of the year and also the furthest the sun sets in the northwest before heading back southwest. The sun sets in slightly different spots every day and will reach its furthest to the southwest on Dec. 21, the winter solstice. It then starts its slow march back to the Castle.</p><p>If you stand at the Old Town side of Charles Bridge and look toward Prague Castle, the sun crosses the main tower of St. Vitus’ Cathedral, lighting up the top chamber; goes past the bell tower over the small altar; and disappears behind the roof before the edge of the sun peeks out of the church’s apse. It then sets behind the roof of the adjacent All Saints’ Church.</p><p>While the official sunset time is after 9 p.m., if you want to see the sun cross the tops of the cathedral towers and set on the roof, you need to get to Charles Bridge a little after 8 pm, as the Castle is on a hill. The whole show is over around 8:30 p.m.</p><p>A decade or so ago, just one or two people would show up for the event but word has gotten out about it, and now there are usually crowds on the bridge and in Křižovnické náměstí, the square next to the bridge.</p><p>If the sky is completely overcast you can go a day or two earlier or later to see pretty much the same effect. This year, the forecast is for rain on June 21, but partly cloudy skies on June 20. A few clouds make for better pictures, as they can catch the colors of the setting sun.</p><p>You can also watch the event online in color since <a data-cu='"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8lIX7CcdJg'" data-cwid='"1904791'" href='"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8lIX7CcdJg'" target='"_blank'">a live camera</a> is installed on top of the Old Town bridge tower, streaming 24 hours a day. It flips direction but will be showing the Castle view half the time.</p><p>In English, the alignment is sometimes called the Prague Stonehenge, referring to the stone circle in Britain that also has astronomical alignments. In Czech, it is called “Pražské slunovratové mystérium” – the Prague solstice mystery. The word “mystery” in this case is used in the religious sense of a hidden spiritual aspect.</p><p>The alignment isn’t due to random chance. Emperor Charles IV was instrumental in building both St. Vitus’ Cathedral and what is now called Charles Bridge, and by all accounts, he took astrology very seriously, as was typical for the era he lived in. The name Charles Bridge wasn’t used until 1870. Previously, it was called the Stone Bridge or Prague Bridge.</p><p>Astrologers allegedly picked the time that construction started on Charles Bridge so it would create a numerical palindrome of odd digits: 1357-9-7-531, meaning the year 1357 at the 9th day of the 7th month at 5:31 in the morning in Old Bohemian time.</p><p>Architect Petr Parléř worked on both St. Vitus’ Cathedral and Charles Bridge, so he would have been able to ensure they lined up. A statue of St. Vitus in a large circle representing the sun is on the facade of the bridge’s Old Town tower. This creates a further link between the sun, the tower, and St. Vitus’ Cathedral.</p><p>You should not stare directly at the sun for too long, especially if the sky is clear and the sun is bright. Taking periodic glances while wearing dark sunglasses is recommended, and other options are watching the sun through the screen of your phone or camera or watching it online.</p>",sunset-on-the-solstice-photo-raymond-johnston-bpvsh

He did not take a breath test before starting his shift, despite arriving late for work. The failure to test the driver was found to be a contributing factor to the accident.</p><p>The Pendolino driver died in the accident, and four workers on the cargo train that was hit and one railway worker on the Pendolino had minor injuries.

The Pendolino was traveling at a speed of 57 km/h at the time.</p><p>The report said the driver, after arriving from Prague to Bohumín, consumed alcohol and was in “a state of moderate intoxication.” This condition results in a clear decrease in attention and a significant slowing down of physical performance.</p><p>While the Pendolino was usually ready to depart at 4:30 a.m., it did not appear at the platform until 4:57 a.m., two minutes before the regular train departure time.</p><p>A train engineer in Bohumín testified that the deceased train driver had a history of being late. Staff who worked with him in Prague said that he seemed to be conscientious. According to the passengers, the Pendolino did not brake before the collision, which was confirmed by the data recorded by the registration speedometer.</p><p>The report drew attention to the fundamental misconduct of the Czech Railways as well, which has an internal directive that if the train driver gets on board late, he must take a breath test for the presence of alcohol, but this did not take place. ČD only discovered the Pendolino train driver''s late start based on a notification from the Railway Administration dispatcher at 4:47 a.m.</p><p>The railway inspection also addressed the conditions at the boarding house in Bohumín. Train drivers often criticize the state of the dormitory. The internal facilities did not meet current accommodation standards, the inspectors said. They drew attention to the high temperature in the room, but it was only after this event that ČD  equipped the room with mobile air conditioning.</p>",train-crash-near-bohumin-claims-a-life-photo-vis-facebook-drazni-inspekce-cdlfv

The increased interest in vinyl can be attributed to factors such as the authentic sound, the ceremonial aspect of playing records, and the aesthetic appeal of album covers. The popularity of vinyl has also led to an increase in sales of record players.</p>",state-duma-chairman-vyacheslav-volodin-has-told-russians-that-president-petr-pav-mbeqb

Research <a data-cu='"https://ilom.cz/'" data-cwid='"1904611'" href='"https://ilom.cz/'" target='"_blank'">from the League of Open Men</a> reveals that three-quarters of fathers in Czechia would take two months of parental leave, which is required by an EU directive but yet to be implemented.</p><p>Societal stereotypes and disparities in income between men and women in the country hinder men''s fight for more parental leave. To facilitate this societal shift, greater support from employers and legislative changes are crucial. On this Father''s Day, the changing landscape of fatherhood in the Czech Republic comes into greater focus.</p><p><strong>An expanding role for fathers in the Czech Republic</strong></p><p>The League of Open Men, a Czech organization dedicated to men''s issues, reports a significant increase in men''s engagement in childcare and their evolving priorities within families over the past decade. Modern fathers in the Czech Republic are increasingly involved in various aspects of child-rearing, such as accompanying children to doctor visits, purchasing groceries, and tending to sick children.</p><p>The involvement of Czech fathers in evening hygiene routines has risen from 15 percent in 2010 to 31 percent in 2020, according to data shared by the organization. Moreover, more men now prioritize family over work, with 71 percent valuing family time over their careers, compared to 56 percent in 2010. This shift reflects changing societal expectations in the Czech Republic, and highlights the desire of fathers to play an active role in their children''s lives.</p><p><strong>The benefits of active fatherhood</strong></p><p>International studies from countries like <a data-cu='"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305002389_Father_involvement_with_young_children_in_The_United_States'" data-cwid='"1904618'" href='"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305002389_Father_involvement_with_young_children_in_The_United_States'" target='"_blank'">the United States</a> and <a data-cu='"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332331776_Fathers''_involvement_with_their_children_in_the_United_Kingdom_Recent_trends_and_class_differences'" data-cwid='"1904618'" href='"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332331776_Fathers''_involvement_with_their_children_in_the_United_Kingdom_Recent_trends_and_class_differences'" target='"_blank'">the United Kingdom</a> emphasize the positive impact of involved fathers on their children''s social development. Actively participating in childcare decreases the likelihood of developmental issues and leads to better academic outcomes for children.</p><p>Furthermore, men''s engagement in family life has a positive effect on both partners, enhancing their physical and mental well-being while reducing the probability of relationship crises and divorce. Women also benefit from increased opportunities in the labor market when fathers are more involved in parenting. Thus, active fatherhood contributes to healthier and more balanced family dynamics.</p><p><strong>Supportive measures for fathers</strong></p><p>To encourage greater involvement of fathers in childcare, employers in the Czech Republic have started offering extended paternity leave beyond the allocated two-week period. This demonstrates that fathers desire an equal role in their families, and it is imperative for the state to respond to their needs.</p><p>One critical aspect affecting parental leave uptake is the amount of parental allowance, as lower-income individuals, often women, tend to remain on leave. Experience from other countries shows that non-transferable portions of parental leave designated for fathers can promote their participation. </p><p>European Union member states were required to ensure two months of non-transferable parental leave for fathers by August 2, 2022, according to a 2019 directive. However, implementation in the Czech Republic is still pending. Alongside improved legislation, financial incentives and flexibility in drawing parental leave can play pivotal roles in motivating fathers to take an active part in caring for their children.</p><p><strong>Campaigning for change</strong></p><p>In commemoration of Father''s Day, the <a data-cu='"https://ilom.cz/'" data-cwid='"1904626'" href='"https://ilom.cz/'" target='"_blank'">League of Open Men</a>, in collaboration with the educational platform <a data-cu='"https://marter.cz/'" data-cwid='"1904626'" href='"https://marter.cz/'" target='"_blank'">M.ARTER</a>, is launching <a data-cu='"https://www.facebook.com/reel/629109829158703'" data-cwid='"1904626'" href='"https://www.facebook.com/reel/629109829158703'" target='"_blank'">a social media campaign</a>. The campaign aims to promote active fatherhood by sharing real stories from fathers who have taken parental leave and continue to be engaged in their children''s lives.</p><p>Currently, only around two percent of men in the Czech Republic take optional parental leave, largely due to financial concerns and societal perceptions of fatherhood. Through this initiative, fathers can find inspiration, support, and encouragement to take a more active role in parenting, fostering stronger bonds with their children.</p><p>The League of Open Men has long been advocating for active fatherhood, offering educational events, workshops, and support for both fathers and mothers.

There will be demonstrations of service dog training, close combat, an L-159 fighter jet simulator, an exhibition by the Czech Army Honor Guard, and autograph sessions with athletes from the Army Sports Center Dukla.</p><p>The army will also set up booths where the various components of the Ministry of Defense and the army, including state-owned enterprises, will be presented.

The president, who took office on March 9 and completes his first 100 days this Saturday, said that he managed to fulfill most of his short-term goals and develop most of his long-term aims. </p><p>Pavel said his mission during his five-year term rests on two key pillars. The first is to ensure Czechia continues its firmly pro-Western and democratic course. The second and more emotionally based pillar is to change the mood in Czech society so that people believe they can change something if they want to.</p><p>He recalled that after taking office he said that he would rather be criticized for high, productive activity than for a lukewarm start. He pointed out that he had a justified feeling that there was a lot of catching up to do after his predecessor Miloš Zeman. </p><p>After his inauguration, Pavel set a total of eight goals for his first hundred days in office. These were – among others – making the Prague Castle more accesible; better interaction between the state and public; more government transparency and more productive communication; boosting Czechia’s presence on the world stage; and the appointment of new judges.</p><p>Since March, the much-maligned security checks at Prague Castle have been removed, helping ease queues to the castle premises. He plans to further open up the Castle grounds to the public during his term.</p><p>He has also been active in governmental affairs, actively listening to members of the opposition, as well as meeting with Prime Minister Petr Fiala and Labor and Social Affairs Minister Marian Jurečka to discuss the details of Czechia''s pension reform (and providing his own opinion).</p><p>Although he promised a deep audit of the Office of the President of the Republic, the Forestry Administration of Lány, and the Administration of the Prague Castle, the setting up of transparent management methods are still listed on the Prague Castle website as being '"in process.'"</p><p>Pavel has also assumed a very active role in foreign relations. He has traveled to Ukraine to meet his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy, promising unequivocal continued support for the war-stricken country – including increased financial and military aid.</p><p>He also represented Czechia in various other ways, such as during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, a Council of Europe summit in Iceland, and most recently speaking at the European Values Summit 2023 in Prague. He also visited Slovakia twice, as well as attending a summit in Denmark.</p><p>He discussed EU affairs with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz; traveled to Poland to meet Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and to Vienna to meet with senior Austrian politicians and discuss military relations; attended British King Charles III’s coronation;  and clearly signaled a wish to forge closer ties with Taiwan. </p><p>According to <a data-cu='"https://pravybreh.cz/sto-dni-petra-pavla/'" data-cwid='"1904191'" href='"https://pravybreh.cz/sto-dni-petra-pavla/'" target='"_blank'">political analyst Lubomír Kopeček</a> of the National Institute for Research on Socioeconomic Impacts of Diseases and Systemic Risks (SYRI), Pavel is '"fulfilling expectations so far.'" Kopecek also says that Pavel is meeting public demand by traveling extensively to different Czech regions.</p><p>He has also worked toward promoting politics among younger people. Just this week, for example, he published a video in collaboration with students on his new, sold-out postage stamps.</p><p>In June, Pavel also held a roundtable discussion with several selected members of Generation Z. '"A strategy and a plan of specific activities for the young generation are being prepared with the ambassadors,'" the president said in material for journalists.</p><p>Activities that break from the conventional perception of a head of state, such as a motorcycle trip to Bavaria, have also further endeared him to the public. According to Kopeček, Pavel’s non-abrasive, non-controversial style – in comparison with his predecessor – is largely welcomed by the Czech public.</p><p>On the judicial side, he appointed three judges to Czechia’s Constitutional Court, making good on his earlier promise. The president took a major step toward the transparency of the selection when he declared in public how he would proceed. During a visit to the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday – his first – Pavel urged more communication, transparency, and dialogue among politicians and also between the public.</p><p>Indeed, public trust in Czechia’s president has risen markedly since Petr Pavel took office in March, with almost 60 percent of the Czech public reporting they trust him according to the <a data-cu='"https://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/cz/32-politicke/instituce-a-politici/5671-duvera-ustavnim-institucim-duben-kveten-2023'" data-cwid='"1904193'" href='"https://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/cz/32-politicke/instituce-a-politici/5671-duvera-ustavnim-institucim-duben-kveten-2023'" target='"_blank'">Czech Public Opinion Research Center</a>.</p><p>In his conference today, Pavel said: '"I would like to see the success of my presidency reflected in our nation regaining a healthy self-confidence and determination to change things for the better.'"

Czechia originally planned to receive CZK 179 billion from the plan in the form of subsidies only.</p><p>The loans and grants are poised to inject much-needed impetus into the nation''s key sectors through ambitious initiatives designed to tackle several pressing challenges. Foremost among these is the commitment to wean Czechia off fossil fuels, thus paving the way for a greener, more sustainable future.</p><p>A strong emphasis has also been placed on embracing digitalization, enabling the country to harness the transformative power of technology and fortify its competitive edge. The plan also prioritizes comprehensive reforms in the field of education, aiming to create a robust and inclusive learning environment for all citizens.</p><p>The National Recovery Plan also allocates substantial resources toward the critical areas of accessible housing and geriatric care. By addressing the pressing need for affordable housing, the government seeks to improve living conditions and promote social welfare. Substantial investments in care for the elderly will ensure that the country''s aging population receives the support and services it requires.</p><p>While the plan embodies an ambitious vision, some adjustments had to be made to align it with the available funding. Minister of European Affairs Martin Dvořák acknowledged that certain ministries – notably the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education – had to revise their financial requests to accommodate the revised plan. </p><p>Looking ahead, Dvořák shared the government''s fiscal aspirations, highlighting the objective to achieve a deficit of CZK 270 billion for the upcoming year. </p><p>Budgetary revenues for the first four months of the year reached CZK 533.9 billion, while expenditures reached CZK 733.9 billion, making it difficult for the government to maintain its approved full-year deficit goal.

Škoda Auto, the country''s largest car manufacturer, experienced a significant production increase of 34.4 percent, resulting in 375,981 cars being produced. </p><p>The Czech women''s basketball team began the EuroBasket European championship in Tel Aviv with a 61:58 victory over Italy, despite losing by 14 points in the third quarter. The team will next play Belgium on Friday; the match starts at 11:15 a.m. (Central European time).</p><p>Also in Czechia’s group is hosting nation Israel, which will face Czechia on June 18.

He also stressed that Ukraine cannot begin the accession process while still engaged in conflict with Russia. </p><p>Pavel firmly believed that Ukraine''s inclusion in NATO and the EU would ensure regional stability, strengthen both organizations, and help restrain Russia''s aggressive policies. He also highlighted the benefits Ukraine''s membership would bring to NATO, citing their experienced military and readiness for membership in the near future.</p><p>An expert group in the Czech Olympic Committee (ČOV) has today stated that Russian and Belarusian athletes should sign an affidavit condemning aggression against any UN state by another country before their possible start under a neutral flag at the Paris Olympics next year. In practice, this would actually mean condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The COV continues to be against any form of Russian and Belarus participation in Olympic qualifications and at the Paris Olympic Games in Paris in 2024, its representatives confirmed today. The Czech Senate said in March that the ČOV should not allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the upcoming 2024 Olympics in Paris. </p><p>A study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group and the research-focused Aspen Institute reveals that Czechia will need to invest CZK 3.2 trillion by 2050 to transition to a carbon-free economy. </p><p>Immediate investments are necessary, focusing on technology that can be exported to other countries in order to maintain the country''s competitiveness and ensure a high standard of living for its population. By 2030, approximately CZK 1.2 trillion will need to be invested, with the energy sector requiring the majority of these funds, followed by industry, transport, automotive, agriculture, and waste management sectors to a lesser extent.</p><p>On Thursday, the Prague hygiene station confirmed the occurrence of salmonella in a hotel in Bečvářova Street in Prague 10.

The damages caused by his actions exceeded CZK 7.2 million. Despite his denial of any wrongdoing, Cechmanek, now working as a chief coach of youth in the Uherské Hradiště hockey club, had originally faced the possibility of an eight-year prison term.</p><p>Members of parliament in the Chamber of Deputies are meeting this afternoon to discuss amendments to the Labor Code, which – among other things – could introduce the right to shorter working hours or guaranteed remote work for parents of children under the age of nine. </p><p>They also seek to establish a clearer definition of contract work: if one amendment passes, contractors will also have the right to bonus pay for holiday, weekend, or nighttime work, or for working in challenging work conditions. Politicians will also discuss whether providing payments for employees who work from home – planned to be a minimum of CZK 2.8 per hour – will be optional or mandatory for employers.</p><p>President Petr Pavel is set to assess his first hundred days in office with a press conference and a meeting with Prime Minister Petr Fiala. According to analysts, Pavel has made significant changes to the government, appointing ministers and constitutional judges since taking office.</p><p>His efforts to mediate discussions between the government and opposition, engage with civil society, and coordinate foreign policy have been praised by political scientists. Pavel''s tenure marks the fourth consecutive change in government since March when he succeeded Miloš Zeman.</p><p>The Federation of Jewish Communities (FZO) in the Czech Republic reported a significant increase in anti-Semitic incidents in 2022, with 2,277 incidents recorded compared to 1,128 in 2021. Most incidents occurred online, particularly on social media platforms, accounting for 97 percent of all reported cases. FZO emphasized that anti-Semitically motivated violence remains isolated in the country, and no violent acts against Jews were registered last year. </p><p>The federation also noted that while far-right websites are decreasing, disinformation sites, including pro-Russian platforms, are utilizing anti-Semitic rhetoric. Social media platforms were identified as the dominant platform for the spread of anti-Semitism, contributing to societal polarization.</p><p>A Smartwings plane traveling from Crete to Prague was forced to make an emergency landing due to a technical fault Wednesday.

The districts did not sufficiently justify taking the sidewalks away from pedestrians. The rulings were both based on the districts'' failures to follow proper procedures and are not a precedent to ban sidewalk parking in general.</p><p>This week, the court canceled sidewalk parking in Horní Street in Prague 4 and in late May did the same for a section of Nerudová Street in Prague 1’s Malá Strana district.

Still, zookeepers urged the public in a message posted on social media to be cautious and inform the zoo of the monkeys'' movement. </p><p>A group of monkeys escaped from the enclosure, with six getting off the premises. Police are investigating a man suspected of damaging an electric fence, through which the animals escaped.

About half an hour later, the officers tracked down the suspect. Police subsequently detained the 42-year-old man and placed him in a police cell. He tested positive for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).</p><p>The incident sparked a number of reactions from social media users who made light of the situation by posting modified images of the primates alongside Děčín landmarks.

The Grand Bar International was once a meeting place for Prague’s notable figures but it has been closed for four decades – until now.</p><p>The renovation of the Grand Bar is part of a larger project to restore the unique International Hotel to its former grandeur. The entire venue has been rebranded as the Grand Hotel International Prague. Completed in 1956, the building is the city’s only example of ornate socialist realist architecture from that decade. </p><p>To the south, you can see Prague Castle from an unusual angle. Looking northeast, you find the Prague Zoo. In the east and west, there are large parks mixed in with residential buildings. But the main attraction is the bar''s interior, a snapshot of style from the previous century.</p><p>The hotel was meant to be the most luxurious in Czechoslovakia, and one of the few places that foreigners could stay. The bar also attracted local celebrities; in its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, frequent guests, for example, included actor Jan Werich and his entourage.</p><p>The highlight of the bar is a mosaic by Czech painter Max Švabinský, whose other credits include designs for Czechoslovak paper money and a stained-glass window in St. Vitus’s Cathedral. Many other artists and craftspeople contributed details including a massive chandelier. Metal outlines of bunches of grapes are a running motif on the stair railings, hinting at the wine available at the bar.</p><p>The bar will be open daily until late. Filip Dlesk, the new director of Grand Hotel International, said that a significant part of the clientele will be hotel guests, but the bar will also be open to the public. There will be a modest entry fee to ensure the Grand Bar remains an exclusive place.</p><p>One of the hotel''s most notable features is a five-pointed star on top of a spire in the middle of the central tower. At first, the star was red, but it has changed color several times over the years and was even removed for a while. It is now back and sporting a golden tone.</p><p>While the hotel has always exuded an air of luxury, the earliest concept was rather utilitarian. It was intended as housing for out-of-town military officers, although in reality it never served this purpose. Before construction started, the plans were repurposed for civilian use with rooms that were above the standards of the time instead of military barracks.</p><p>The hotel played a minor role in Czechoslovak history. It was where foreigners, including the cast of the film The Bridge at Remagan, were brought together during the 1968 Soviet-led invasion.

Still, there are remnants of an anti-nuclear bunker in the basement, which would have been capable of housing 600 people for two weeks. It is now used for storage.  </p>",rooftop-bar-in-the-grand-international-hotel-photo-czech-inn-hotels-nnvqq
